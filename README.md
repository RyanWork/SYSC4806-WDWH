We Do Work Here ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

**Learning Outcomes management system:**  
The goal is to track, edit and update the Learning Outcomes (i.e., the skills a student should acquire after completing a given course. For example, for this course: "is able to deploy a web app to the cloud", "knows enterprise design patterns", "is able to understand SaaS literature") for all the programs in our department. Each course has a set of learning objectives in a given year (these may be changed on a year-by-year basis).
Each learning objective belongs to a Category. There's a limited list of Categories which can be edited by the Administrator (such as "Design", "Communication Skills").
A course belongs to one or many programs, and a program has many courses (in a given year). A course is taught in a given "year" (1st, 2nd etc., not school year)

A user should be able to list, for a given year and for a given program: all the learning outcomes, all the categories, all the learning outcomes within a given category, all the courses covering a given category, all the learning outcomes of a given course. The user should also be able to export any of those results as a CSV (comma-separated) file. An administrator should be able to edit everything.
